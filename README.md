# MobileChallenge
Shopify Challenge for the Mobile Developer position.

The app takes Shopify's API, and presents it onto mobile devices as a list of collections. Users can click on the collection, and the app would search for the products found in that collection.
I used retrofit and okhttp for this project. I followed the tutorial below to help me with the libraries, and recycler view in android studio.

The folder contains the code I used to run the program. The libraries are not present, and must be downloaded.
- http://square.github.io/retrofit/
- http://square.github.io/okhttp/

For testing, download the apk file.
If the download does not work, here is a google drive link that will direct you to the apk file directly: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zJYLp-fVnGk0d68LZdTxf4nqVhXCuOs6/view?usp=sharing
